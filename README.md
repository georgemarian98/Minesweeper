# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

For my project I used the SFML library for the graphic component.

# Installation

After you clone the repository you simply go to  bin/Release folder and click on the Minesweeper exec.

# Usage

First you are required to set the number of rows, columns and bombs in the game, in the console. After that the game begins. Left click reveals the block and right click marks the block as a bomb. In the left top corner is shown the remaining bombs and in the right top corner the elapsed time. If you want to replay the game you can left click on the yellow circle in the top middle. If you want to change the number of rows. columns or bombs you will have to rerun the exec.
